===== PURPOSE =================================================================

This document describes the format of water quality data from the GEMStat database
provided as *.csv files by the GEMS/Water Data Center. 

Be advised that water quality data, for which the data provider has set a  
LIMITED or RESTRICTED data policy are not listed within this dataset, even if 
they were visible in the data portal (https://portal.gemstat.org/). 

LIMITED data is available as download from the portal and by Email request
to gwdc@bafg.de, after acknowledgement that it will bot be used for
commercial purposes. 

RESTRICTED data can only be viewed in the data portal, as national data policies
restrict the data dissemination.

Sample Times of 12:00 or 00:00 are default values for cases, when no Sample 
Time was reported by the data provider.



===== DATA DELIVERED ==========================================================

The data delivery consists of a series of .csv files, all using semicolon as delimiter:
    
    1) GEMStat_station_metadata.csv, containing 
       details on the stations that had data available for the specific request.

    2) GEMStat_parameter_metadata.csv,  
       containing a description of the requested water quality parameters.
    
    3) GEMStat_method_metadata.csv, 
       containing a description of the methods used for analysis of the water 
       samples.
    
    4) A number of csv-Files, containing the actual water quality sample results, 
       split into different parameter groups. Grouping was chosen, so that no file
       exceeded the number of 1,048,576 rows, the maximum number of rows that can be
       displayed by Microsoft Excel software.
